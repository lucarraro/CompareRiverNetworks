# CompareRiverNetworks 

R scripts supporting "Optimal Channel Networks capture ecological dynamics \\ in dendritic river networks" by Luca Carraro and Florian Altermatt.

- `MAIN.R`: main script. It generates real rivers, OCNs, RBNs and BBTs, and evaluates scaling and ecological properties of the various network types.
- `drawFigures.R`: draws all figures of the manuscript and supplementary information.
- `support_functions.R`: contains all auxiliary functions called by `MAIN.R` and `drawFigures.R`.
- `BBT`, `OCN`, `RBN`, `rivers`: folders containing the generated networks.
- `results`: folder containing results obtained by running `MAIN.R`.
